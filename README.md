## My process
  I sketched the prototype and included the bootstrap framework.


### Built with

- HTML5 boilerplate
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap4 framework


### What I learned

This project helped me in sizing using percentage. Normally I like to use pixels but when I got to the point where I had to customize my code for the mobile view, I struggled with using pixels for the width. I realized that using percentage helped me totally and I was able to get the mobile view in minutes (no cap).
I also got to understand media query and how to apply it. My only challenge here was sizing and I'm glad I was able replicate this project 99% (I believe).
The Bootstrap4 framework really helped (big shoutout to the developers and contributors).
